## Pull requests

Please open an issue first and wait for a reply before you start on a pull request, so that no work is
wasted on a change that does not fit the project. Then:

1. Keep the pull request to one topic and link the issue.
2. Run the local checks; CI runs the same:
   ```bash
   (cd tools/flarum2-ops && npm ci && npm test)
   python3 tools/validate.py
   ```
3. Follow the conventions in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); they apply to humans and coding agents alike.
